BATMAN stands next to his batmobile and uses his batcomputer. He's sometimes Bruce Wayne sometimes Batman. All times orphan.
BATMAN
This is now a safe city. I have punched a penguin into prison.
ALFRED, Batman's loyal batler, carries a tray of goth ham.
ALFRED
Eat a dinner, Mattress Wayne.
An explosion explodes. THE JOKER and TWO-FACE enter the cave. Joker is a clown but insane. Two-Face is a man but attorney.
BATMAN
No! It is Two-Face and One-Face.
They hate me for being a bat.
Batman throws Alfred at Two-Face. Two-Face flips Alfred like a coin. Alfred lands heads up which means Two-Face goes home.
BATMAN (CONT'D)
It is just you and I, the Joker. Bat versus clown. Moral enemies.
THE JOKER
I am such a freak. Society is bad. You drink water, I drink anarchy.
BATMAN
I drink bats just like a bat would!
Batman looks around for his parents, but they are still dead. This makes him have anger. He fires a batrocket. The Joker deflects it with his sick sense of humor. A clownly power.
THE JOKER
I have never followed a rule. That is my rule. Do you follow? I don't.
BATMAN
Alfred, give birth to Robin.
Alfred begins the process since it is his job. The Joker now has a present in his hand. He juggles it over to Batman.
THE JOKER
Happy batday, Birthman.
Batman opens the present since he's a good guy. It contains a coupon for new parents, but is expired. This is a Joker joke.
