Personally, I'd like it if my feed was full of things that I actually liked rather than what I hate. And I think if there was a website designed specifically with morals in mind I think it would garner large popularity over time. I think there should be more laws putting restrictions on websites. 
Alot of what websites do seem very amoral, and I don't want them to be like that. I wish the internet was a much more wholesome place to be on. Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which protects platforms from liability for user-generated content, could be reformed to encourage responsibility without stifling free speech.  platforms could remain protected if they demonstrate that their algorithms are designed to minimize harm, such as reducing the spread of false or inflammatory content.

I had a great time with this class and thank you so much for teaching me this year
