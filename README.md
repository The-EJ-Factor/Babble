# Babble
A little project I made a long time ago in c# that outhputs jumbled words in a text file but in a more coherent way.

It takes a text file that you select, reads all the words in the text file, and builds a library containing connections between words. The "order" decides how many words it strings together when choosing the next word it looks at the previous words it has and chooses a random word that has had those words listed previously up to the order number. Basically, the higher the order, the more coherent it is. Also, the number in the textbox is the number of words it outputs.
